#### Interval
Interval of video displayed on the ```Create template image``` window.


#### Replay size[1-1000]
Specified number of images to hold for replay on ```Create template image``` window.

### Precheck before LiveSplit's control
When this check is enabled, the startup check, the current LiveSplit status, and the current Segment are acquired before sending a signal such as Split to LiveSplit, and it is confirmed whether the signal was sent successfully.

If this check is disabled, the time between image matching and LiveSplit recognizing the signal will be reduced by approximately 0.03 seconds.
