# Hotkey Setting

When using LiveSplit, you need only check **Link with LiveSplit**.

### When using a timer other than LiveSplit

Make settings to send signals such as Split to the timer.

- If the timer has global hotkey setting (which accepts keystrokes even when the timer is inactive), enable the setting.
- If there is no global hotkey setting, you will need to focus on the timer before sending the signal. Please see [Focus]({{< ref "/docs/06eachsettingitem/007focus/_index.en.md" >}}) for details.
