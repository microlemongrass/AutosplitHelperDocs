The general flow for using this software is as follows.

1. Install timer software in advance.
2. Create a new profile.

5. (Adjust the parameters in the table as needed.)
6. Execute image recognition processing. \

\
In "Let's try to use", we will explain on the premise of the following matters.

- Use LiveSplit for timer software
- Video capture method is "Screen Capture"
- Target is OBS Studio's "windowed projector"

(Because it is the software used by many RTA players and is compatible with any game.)
